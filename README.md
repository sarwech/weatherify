# weatherify
A neat weather app using the Dark Sky API

Try the [demo](https://codepen.io/sarwech/full/gWRObV/) (Dark Sky API takes a few seconds to return request)
* Shows weather in your current location (may need to provide permission, possible issues with iOS)
* Uses Skycons to display an icon representative of the weather
* Background image changes based on weather!
